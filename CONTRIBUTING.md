# Contributing to Messenger

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Messenger.

## How can you contribute?

### Report an issue
A great way to contribute to the project is to report an issue when you encounter a problem.

### What to expect

When a new issue is opened, we will label it as:
* Needs triage: needs a triage from a member
* under investigation: a member will investigate the issue

After the issue has been investigated, it will be labeled as:
* Will fix: issue will be fixed internally by a member
* [help wanted](https://github.com/amoukaled/messenger_android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22): community contributions are welcome
* Won't fix: issue will be closed without a fix
